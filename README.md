iref.topic
==========

This repository is going to contain prototypes to extract topics from documents, which may improve IR effectiveness. 

The first attempt is a Restricted Boltzmann Machine. To try the RBM example out, you need IREFTools.jar. I suspect that that will work without any problems, but if it gives problems with unresolved dependencies, you can use Maven to resolve them using the pom.xml.
